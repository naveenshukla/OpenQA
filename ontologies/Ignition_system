A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed breaker points and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil\'s core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir that will be used to drive the ignition spark.As the engine turns, the cam inside the distributor rotates. The points ride on the cam so that as a piston reaches the top of the engine\'s compression cycle, the cam causes the breaker points to open. This breaks the primary winding\'s circuit and abruptly stops the current through the breaker points. Without the steady current through the points, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This severe rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil\'s secondary windings.At the same time, current exits the coil\'s primary winding and begins to charge up the capacitor (condenser) that lies across the open breaker points. This capacitor and the coil\xe2\x80\x99s primary windings form an oscillating LC circuit. This LC circuit produces a damped, oscillating current which bounces energy between the capacitor\xe2\x80\x99s electric field and the ignition coil\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field. The oscillating current in the coil\xe2\x80\x99s primary produces an oscillating magnetic field in the coil. This extends the high voltage pulse at the output of the secondary windings. This continues beyond the time of the initial field collapse pulse. The oscillation continues until the circuit\xe2\x80\x99s energy is consumed.The ignition coil\'s high voltage output is directed to the distributor cap. A turning rotor, located on top of the breaker cam within the distributor cap, sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil\'s secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug. This, in turn, ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the ignition coil\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field.The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citro\xc3\xabn 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just contact breakers, in a wasted spark system.Some two-cylinder motorcycles and motor scooters had two contact points feeding twin coils each connected directly to the spark plug without a distributor; e.g. the BSA Thunderbolt and Triumph Tigress.High performance engines with eight or more cylinders that operate at high r.p.m. (such as those used in motor racing) demand both a higher rate of spark and a higher spark energy than the simple ignition circuit can provide. This problem is overcome by using either of these adaptations:Two complete sets of coils, breakers and condensers can be provided - one set for each half of the engine, which is typically arranged in V-8 or V-12 configuration. Although the two ignition system halves are electrically independent, they typically share a single distributor which in this case contains two breakers driven by the rotating cam, and a rotor with two isolated conducting planes for the two high voltage inputs.A single breaker driven by a cam and a return spring is limited in spark rate by the onset of contact bounce or float at high rpm. This limit can be overcome by substituting for the breaker a pair of breakers that are connected electrically in series but spaced on opposite sides of the cam so they are driven out of phase. Each breaker then switches at half the rate of a single breaker and the ""dwell"" time for current buildup in the coil is maximized since it is shared between the breakers. The Lamborghini V-8 engine has both these adaptations and therefore uses two ignition coils and a single distributor that contains 4 contact breakers.A distributor-based system is not greatly different from a magneto system except that more separate elements are involved. There are also advantages to this arrangement. For example, the position of the contact breaker points relative to the engine angle can be changed a small amount dynamically, allowing the ignition timing to be automatically advanced with increasing revolutions per minute (RPM) or increased manifold vacuum, giving better efficiency and performance.However it is necessary to check periodically the maximum opening gap of the breaker(s), using a feeler gauge, since this mechanical adjustment affects the ""dwell"" time during which the coil charges, and breakers should be re-dressed or replaced when they have become pitted by electric arcing. This system was used almost universally until the late 1970s, when electronic ignition systems started to appear.', "An ignition system generates a spark or heats an electrode to a high temperature to ignite a fuel-air mixture in spark ignition internal combustion engines oil-fired and gas-fired boilers, rocket engines, etc. The widest application for spark ignition internal combustion engines is in petrol road vehicles: cars (autos), four-by-fours (SUVs), motorcycles, pickups, vans, trucks, and buses.Compression ignition Diesel engines ignite the fuel-air mixture by the heat of compression and do not need a spark.
